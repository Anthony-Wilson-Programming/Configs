The PresarioCQ60 was originally purchased sometime around 2008 or 2009, and still functions with a working battery.
It originally came with Windows Vista 32bit, though uses x86_64 hardware.
Shortly after I recieved it in early 2020, I dual-booted it with Arch Linux, and a couple of months after that, replaced Windows Vista with a 64 bit installation of Windows 7.
It is currently my daily-driver until I purchase a much newer laptop later this year.
