The PresarioV4000 is a laptop first made & sold in 2003.
The laptop I have is from 2004, and originally came with Windows XP 32bit. It stills runs perfectly, and is surprisingly fast when running a range of applications, such as Processing or Sketchup.
The laptop was dual-booted with Ubuntu 18.04 in 2019, allowing it to run modern software and safely connect to the internet again.
