The configs here are for an iPad Air 2, originally purchased late 2016.
Currently running iPadOS 13.3.1, it is jailbroken to vastly extend the functionality and increase productivity.
There aren't many configs here, even jailbroken iOS doesn't have many backup-able config files, the ones here are mostly for documentation & testing purposes, as well as a backup if necessary.
